If you have any questions or want to continue this project feel free to do so.

### Here are some ideas:
- Improve the "score optic"
- Save the "highsore times"
- Use sprites unstead of draw primitives
- Add some effects (sound, exploding stuff, traps, etc)

- or use it as startup of your own snake version with axis
